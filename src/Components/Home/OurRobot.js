                    Disability robots can assist with daily activities such as
                    bathing, dressing, and eating. They can also help with
                    mobility tasks such as climbing stairs or getting in and out
                    of bed. In addition, disability robots can provide
                    companionship and social interaction for people who are
                    isolated due to their disability. While disability robots
                    vary in their capabilities, they all share the common goal
                    of helping people with disabilities live more independent
                    and fulfilling lives.

                    sensors that detect when a child cries or needs assistance.
                    On the other hand, aged care robots provide assistance and
                    companionship to older adults. They can be programmed to
                    perform simple tasks such as fetching items or providing
                    reminders. Additionally, they are equipped with sensors that
                    allow them to monitor the health of their elderly users.
                    These robots provide an essential service for many people

                    can be of great comfort in the absence of interactions with
                    humans. They have been demonstrated to increase Oxitocin,
                    and other hormones and neurotransmitters, that were thought
                    could only come from living companions. Robot pets have been
                    found to decrease elderly dementia patients’ anxiety,
                    stress, and use of psychoactive and pain medications.

                its basic functions and more advanced features such as
                programming and customizing its behavior. <br /><br />
                We want you to be comfortable with your robot, so we'll take the
                time to make sure you understand everything. By the end of the
                training, you'll be an expert on your new robot and ready to
                start enjoying all its benefits. Most robots will come with an
                android screen, so getting to know this menu will be a must. The
                first thing you'll want to do is navigate to the settings menu.
                From here, you can adjust various aspects of your robot's
                behavior.

                You can choose which programs to install on your robot. If
                you're adventurous, you can explore the wide world of android
                apps. There are thousands of apps available, many designed
